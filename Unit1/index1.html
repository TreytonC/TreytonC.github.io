Let the potatoes cook still for 7 minutes, and then add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil by drizzling it in. Cook for a additional 6 to 8 minutes longer. Afterwards, transfer the ingredients into a medium size bowl and wipe out the skillet.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs, green chilies, salt and pepper until they are well blended. Using the same skillet as before over the same medium-high heat stove, cook the sausage for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until they browned. Add the egg mixture while stirring it in; while letting it cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until scrambled. </li>
    <li>Lay out your tortillas, and when they are laid out, add lines of hash browns down the center of each one. Then top it of with the egg mixture and sprinkle your shredded cheese on top.</li>
    <li>When all the ingredients are on top of the tortillas, roll it up tightly so all the delicious ingredients can stay inside while eating.</li>
